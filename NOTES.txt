#! NOTES

1. Know about "abc" module which is used to implement Abstract Base Classes (ABC) in Python.
2. Know about abstract method and static method in Python.

** Use "https://julius.ai/" for performing EDA tasks by just uploading the dataset and asking it to do certain tasks.
Example -> "
I uploaded the file: AmesHousing.csv
How many columns are there and which columns contains space or null value? Give me those column names and plot a graph to show the numbers too
"

#? Always use Factory Design Pattern in your project i.e concept of using interface and factory.
* Refer explanations/factory_design_patter.py

"
Abstract Class: A class that serves as a template and cannot be instantiated directly. It may contain both abstract and concrete methods.
Abstract Method: A method within an abstract class that must be implemented by any subclass. It has no implementation in the abstract class itself.
"

Always ensure these key elements in your project:
* Type Checks
* Readability
* Handling Errors
* Documentation
* Testing

#? Always use Strategy Design Pattern in your project i.e concept of using interface, strategy and context(helps to switch different strategies).
* Refer explanations/strategy_design_patter.py
